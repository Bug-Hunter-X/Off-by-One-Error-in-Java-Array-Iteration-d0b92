This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration.  The bug causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the loop iterates one element beyond the array's valid index. The solution shows how to correct the loop to avoid this error.  This example illustrates a frequent mistake made by Java programmers, especially when dealing with arrays and loops.
